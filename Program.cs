        //A feature that allows us to access any concepts' (class, struct, delegate, method, etc.) info and manipulate them in runtime.
        
        //Reflection has 3 main usage purposes;
        //-Type Info Check: We can review any concepts' name, properties, methods, fields, etc. info.
        //Thus, we can dynamically take actions based on this info by accessing them in runtime.
        //-New Type Creation or Load One: Reflection makes it possible to create new types or load the ones from .dll files.
        //-Running Members Dynamically: We can call or run members such as methods and properties via reflection
